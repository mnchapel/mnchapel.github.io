personal_work_abstract: Some cardiac procedures are now performed using endovascular and endocavitary access. In these cases, the clinician is guided solely by 2D fluoroscopic imaging, which has certain limitations when it comes to visualizing the structures of interest. In certain procedures, such as cardiac biopsy or stem cell insertion, better targeting of infarcted areas of cardiac muscle is sought. Intra-operative assistance for this type of operation would enable the procedure to be more precise and the therapy more effective.
