project_abstract: "Although UV filters are detected in high concentrations in aquatic ecosystems, bio-accumulated and bio-magnified in the food chain, their toxicity remains poorly assessed. Indeed, despite research into the toxicity of these compounds in freshwater ecosystems, little attention has been paid to marine ecosystems. In parallel with UV filter contamination, heat waves cause drastic increases in water temperature. While a few studies have focused on the impact of UV filters, none have examined the combined effects of these 2 factors (i.e. UV filter contamination and temperature rise) on marine organisms."
