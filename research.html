	<b>Abstract</b>: Moving objects detection in video streams is a commonly used technique in many
computer vision algorithms. The detection becomes more complex when the camera
is moving. The environment observed by this type of camera appeared moving and
it is more difficult to distinguish the objects which are in movement from the others
that composed the static part of the scene.
In this thesis we propose contributions for the detection of moving objects in
the video stream of a moving camera. The main idea to differenciate between
moving and static objects based on 3D distances. 3D positions of feature points
extracted from images are estimated by triangulation and then their 3D motions
are analyzed in order to provide a sparse static/moving labeling. To provide a more
robust detection, the analysis of the 3D motions is compared to those of feature
points previously estimated static. A confidance value updated over time is used to
decide on labels to attribute to each point.
We make experiments on virtual (from the Previz project) and real datasets
(known by the community) and we compare the results with the state
of the art. The results show that our 3D constraint coupled with a statistical and
temporal analysis of motions allow to detect moving elements in the video stream of
a moving camera even in complex cases where apparent motions of the scene are
not similars.
