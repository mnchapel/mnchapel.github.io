<p>I defended my PhD in computer science in September 2017 at the Universit√© Lyon 1, France under the direction of Erwan Guillou and Saida Bouakaz. My PhD dissertation was entitled "Moving Objects Detection with a Moving Camera".</p>

<p>My research focused on the distinction of the real movement of a moving object from the apparent motion in the video stream caused by the motion of the camera. I proposed a new approach that uses geometric cues to classify features points as static or moving. By relying on objects estimated static, it is possible to distinguish moving objects from the static ones in the video stream of a moving camera thanks to the comparison of 3D euclidean distances over time. During my PhD I developed two programs to make experimental results. The first one, named MoBDec, computes the feature points classification and the second one, Achab, visualizes the results at the different steps.</p>

<p>I am currently broaden my skills to machine learning. Feel free to visit my <a href="https://github.com/mnchapel/machine_learning">github repository</a> on Machine Learning.</p>
