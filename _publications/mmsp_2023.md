abstract: In order to combat fraud, identity documents and currencies often include security elements such as guilloches, micro prints or holograms. This paper aims to authenticate such documents from videos acquired with a smartphone by analyzing the holograms. The proposed method consists of recognizing all the patterns of the hologram to determine if the document is genuine or not. The Local Binary Patterns (LBP) descriptor is used in this paper to represent the features of a hologram. For a given document, Multi LBP Models are built as a reference model. This model is then compared to the LBP models of the tested hologram to decide if the hologram exist or not in the document and then to determine if the document is genuine or not. Experiments are carried out on holograms of French Passports and Euro banknotes. The results show that the proposed strategy allows to determine if the document is an authentic document or falsified in a good accuracy.
