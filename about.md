<h4><i>Postdoctoral researcher</i></h4>
<br>
<p>My research mainly focused on the use of background subtraction technics to detect moving objects during my PhD but also during my research projects as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>

<p>I enjoyed working with biologists during my postdoc at L3i because these are meaningful projects and I would like to be able to continue contributing to them.</p>
